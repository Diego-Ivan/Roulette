# [WIP] Roulette

A GTK4 + Libadwaita application that has an spinning roulette.

Currently, it still does not implement randomization, but it can retrieve items
to create a roulette based on such information. There is a functioning Cairo
backend to draw the roulette, but given its CPU overhead there is a GL backend
on the works.
